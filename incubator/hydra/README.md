# Hydra
[Hydra](https://github/ory/hdya) offers OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 capabilities as a service. Hydra is different, because it works with any existing authentication infrastructure, not just LDAP or SAML. By implementing a consent app (works with any programming language) you build a bridge between Hydra and your authentication infrastructure.

Hydra is able to securely manage JSON Web Keys, and has a sophisticated policy-based access control you can use if you want to.
